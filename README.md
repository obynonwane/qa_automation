# QA End-to-End Test Suite

This repository contains the end-to-end (E2E) automation suite for Polygon’s web applications, built using **Playwright**.
The suite supports **multiple UI projects**, **environment-based URLs**, and **nightly CI runs**.

---

## Features

* Modern Playwright E2E setup
* Multi-project structure (`staking-ui`, `validator-ui`, etc.)
* Reusable fixtures, helpers, selectors
* CI-ready (GitHub Actions)
* Visual HTML reports with traces & screenshots
* Tag-based test execution (`@smoke`, `@regression`, `@critical`)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

---

# Running Tests

## Run all tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

## Run headed (visible browser)

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

## Run only one project (e.g., staking UI – Chromium)

```bash
npx playwright test --project=staking-ui-chromium
```

## Run one specific test file

```bash
npx playwright test projects/staking-ui/tests/staking.spec.ts
```

---

## Running Tests Using Tags (`@smoke`, `@regression`, `@critical`)

Tags are added inside **test titles**:

```ts
test('@smoke staking page loads', async ({ page }) => { ... });

test('@regression validator detail opens', async ({ page }) => { ... });

test('@critical APR label is visible', async ({ page }) => { ... });
```

### Run Smoke Tests Only

```bash
npx playwright test --grep "@smoke"
```

### Run Regression Tests Only

```bash
npx playwright test --grep "@regression"
```

### Run Critical Tests Only

```bash
npx playwright test --grep "@critical"
```

### Run Smoke Tests in a Specific Project

```bash
npx playwright test \
  --project=staking-ui-chromium \
  --grep "@smoke"
```

### Run Everything *Except* Regression

```bash
npx playwright test --grep-invert "@regression"
```
